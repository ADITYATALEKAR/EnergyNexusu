## 2. Performance Metrics Framework

### 2.1 Primary Performance Metrics

#### 2.1.1 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**Formula:** 
```
MAE = (1/n) * Σ|y_true - y_pred|
```

**Rationale:** 
- Direct interpretability in energy units (MW, GW)
- Equal weighting of all errors regardless of magnitude
- Robust to outliers compared to squared error metrics
- Primary metric for energy system operators

**Application:**
- Overall model accuracy assessment
- Cross-horizon performance comparison
- Operational decision-making relevance

**Thresholds for Energy Systems:**
- Excellent: < 5% of mean demand
- Good: 5-10% of mean demand
- Acceptable: 10-15% of mean demand
- Poor: > 15% of mean demand

#### 2.1.2 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
**Formula:**
```
RMSE = √[(1/n) * Σ(y_true - y_pred)²]
```

**Rationale:**
- Penalizes large errors more heavily than MAE
- Critical for grid stability assessment
- Sensitive to peak demand prediction errors
- Standard metric in energy forecasting literature

**Application:**
- Peak demand forecasting assessment
- Grid stability impact evaluation
- Model comparison with literature benchmarks

**Interpretation Guidelines:**
- RMSE/MAE ratio indicates error distribution
- Ratio ≈ 1.0: Uniform error distribution
- Ratio > 1.3: Presence of large errors requiring attention

#### 2.1.3 Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
**Formula:**
```
MAPE = (100/n) * Σ|((y_true - y_pred) / y_true)|
```

**Rationale:**
- Scale-independent relative performance measure
- Facilitates comparison across different energy systems
- Intuitive interpretation as percentage error
- Industry standard for forecasting evaluation

**Application:**
- Cross-system performance comparison
- Relative accuracy assessment
- Business impact quantification

**Energy System Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: < 3% MAPE
- Good: 3-5% MAPE
- Acceptable: 5-10% MAPE
- Poor: > 10% MAPE

#### 2.1.4 Coefficient of Determination (R²)
**Formula:**
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
where SS_res = Σ(y_true - y_pred)²
      SS_tot = Σ(y_true - y_mean)²
```

**Rationale:**
- Measures proportion of variance explained by the model
- Standardized metric for model explanatory power
- Enables comparison with statistical models
- Critical for model validation and acceptance

**Application:**
- Model explanatory power assessment
- Comparison with statistical baselines
- Variance decomposition analysis

**Interpretation Scale:**
- Excellent: R² > 0.90
- Good: 0.80 < R² ≤ 0.90
- Moderate: 0.70 < R² ≤ 0.80
- Poor: R² ≤ 0.70

### 2.2 Secondary Performance Metrics

#### 2.2.1 Directional Accuracy
**Formula:**
```
DA = (1/(n-1)) * Σ I(sign(Δy_true) = sign(Δy_pred))
where Δy = y_t - y_{t-1}
      I() is the indicator function
```

**Rationale:**
- Critical for energy trading and market operations

- Poor: < 55% directional accuracy

#### 2.2.2 Peak Demand Accuracy
**Formula:**
```
PDA = (1/n_peaks) * Σ|peak_true - peak_pred| / peak_true
where peaks are identified using local maxima detection
```

**Rationale:**
- Critical for grid stability and capacity planning
- Infrastructure investment decisions
- Emergency response preparation

**Application:**
- Grid stability assessment
- Capacity planning validation
- Infrastructure investment support

#### 2.2.3 Renewable Integration Metrics

**Renewable Forecast Error (RFE):**
```
RFE = MAE(renewable_generation) / mean(renewable_generation)
```

**Renewable Penetration Accuracy (RPA):**
```
RPA = 1 - |penetration_true - penetration_pred| / penetration_true
```

**Rationale:**
- Specific to renewable energy integration challenges
- Critical for grid stability with high renewable penetration
- Policy and investment decision support

### 2.3 Energy-Specific Performance Indicators

#### 2.3.1 Load Factor Prediction Accuracy
**Formula:**
```
LFPA = 1 - |LF_true - LF_pred|
where LF = average_demand / peak_demand
```

#### 2.3.2 Ramp Rate Prediction Error
**Formula:**
```
RRPE = MAE(|demand_t - demand_{t-1}|)
```

#### 2.3.3 System Balance Error
**Formula:**
```
SBE = MAE(total_generation - total_demand)
```
