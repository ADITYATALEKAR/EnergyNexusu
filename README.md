# EnergyNexus: LSTM-Based Energy Demand, Energy Price, and Wind Energy Generation Prediction

## What This Project Does
This project creates smart algorithms that help power companies decide when to use solar panels, wind turbines, or regular power plants to give people electricity in the most efficient way.

## How to Run This Project
1. Install Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main program: `python scripts/run_simulation.py`

## Project Structure
- `src/` = All the main code lives here
- `data/` = Where we store energy data
- `notebooks/` = Jupyter notebooks for testing ideas
- `results/` = Where results are saved
